Welcome to the introduction of my interaction design project, in this project I will be gamifying learning apps, the purpose of this is to make learning experiences more engaging and interactive. <br>

Gamification is where we apply game design to non-game contexts, like education. This is to increase users overall ingagement and enjoyment while learning. <br>

This project has 4 main steps, these are a competetive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. These will help me to find good and bad things in the market and find areas for improvement. <br>

Wireframing and prototyping allowed us to create and design the interface and the user experience of the app, which then makes sure that people have fun learning without problems. <br>

Lastly, the usability testing was done to get feedback from users on the app, bases on both usability and how it functions, the feedback will be used to improve the app, making it better for users in the future. <br>

The overall aim is to make a learning app that is both good for learning and enjoyable to use, which should then improve the users learning.  <br>
